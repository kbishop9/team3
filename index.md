SMFG 386 â€“ Manufacturing Automation Systems
Semester Project**


**Objective:**
	The purpose of this project is to work with our group and provide in depth specifications of our automated hydroponic system.

**Bill of Materials:**
	In lab 6 our group compiled a bill of materials for our semester project. The list consisted of all parts for the system with quantity, retailer, and web link to purchase. The produce our group has chosen to grow in the system is butter lettuce because of its relative ease to grow compared to other crops, and because of its small footprint requiring no support structure.

**Areas where further knowledge is needed:**
	One of the areas that we are still lacking in knowledge of is the wiring of the system. We do not have previous knowledge or experience of wiring systems like this. We will need further information to move forward with this portion of the project. We beleive that the compnents chosen in our Bill Of Materials are viable for use in a hydroponic system like we are designing.
