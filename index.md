**1. Objective:**
	The purpose of this project is to work with our group and provide in depth specifications of our automated hydroponic system. To get this project to its final stage, research and design occured over multiple labs and group meetings. During these meetings, we were able to idenify and correct potential design/system flaws that would have otherwise hindered the functionality of the hydroponic system.  




**2. Physical Viewpoint**
The physical viewpoint shows how the system should be set up, connected, and ultimately flow. This includes important items like the Raspberry Pi, module and sensory equipment. The physical viewpoint allows the user to be able to view proper setup of the system.

**4. Ladder Diagram**
The ladder diagram is showing how the PLC programming will work for our hydroponic system. The "On-switch" is used to turn on the relay to the pumps and the nutrients. If nutrients are low, the solution pump will turn on. If the PPM is high in the water solution, the pump will also turn on. Below is the visual representation and code.

**6. Bill of Materials:**
	In lab 6 our group compiled a bill of materials for our semester project. The list consisted of all parts for the system with quantity, retailer, and web link to purchase. The produce our group has chosen to grow in the system is butter lettuce because of its relative ease to grow compared to other crops, and because of its small footprint requiring no support structure.

**7. Areas where further knowledge is needed:**
	One of the areas that we are still lacking in knowledge of is the wiring of the system. We do not have previous knowledge or experience of wiring systems like this. We will need further information to move forward with this portion of the project. We beleive that the compnents chosen in our Bill Of Materials are viable for use in a hydroponic system like we are designing.
